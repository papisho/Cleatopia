- using font-size and font-style
- font-size: 1em -> means the same size as the parent 

-> difference between 1em and 1rem
<body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <footer>
        <h2>Hello2</h2>
    </footer>
</body>

em -> if h2 was 2em, and footer was 20px, then h2 will be 2 x 20 = 40px. 
        But if we change the footer from 20px to 40px, the h2 will be 2 x 40 = 80px.
rem -> if h2 was 2rem and we change the footer from  20px to 40px, it doesn't affect h2.
